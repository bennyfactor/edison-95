Battery
=====================

Go wireless with Edison!  The Battery board brings a single cell LiPo Charger and 400mah battery to power an Intel Edision and expansion cards.  The Battery board can be used with an external battery to increase runtime.  Simply plug in a micro USB cable to charge.  The power switch removes the battery from the Edison while allowing it to charge via the microUSB cable.
